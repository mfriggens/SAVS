# System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species (SAVS)

## Overview

The System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species (SAVS) is a simple and flexible tool designed to help managers assess the relative risk of individual species to population declines in response to projected climate change. Developed by the Rocky Mountain Research Station, SAVS uses an online questionnaire with 22 criteria to predict vulnerability or population response of species and provide a framework for assessing vulnerability to future climate change.

## Key Features

- Online questionnaire with 22 criteria
- Assesses vulnerability of terrestrial vertebrate species to climate change
- Generates scores for overall vulnerability and four categories: habitat, physiology, phenology, and biotic interactions
- Scores range from -20 (most resilient) to +20 (most vulnerable)
- Includes uncertainty assessment

## How It Works

1. **Data Gathering**: Collect climate projections for the target region and species data.
2. **Scoring**: Complete the questionnaire based on gathered data, indicating the level of uncertainty for each question.
3. **Score Calculation**: The tool generates an overall score and category scores, which can be used to identify vulnerable species and inform management strategies.

## Applicability

- Identify highly vulnerable or resilient species
- Rank species according to their vulnerabilities
- Inform management planning and conservation efforts
- Identify critical management actions or areas of need
- Guide further monitoring or research efforts

## Resources

- RMRS General Technical Report: "A System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species (SAVS) to Climate Change" (in press)
- Sample assessments: New Mexico (Friggens et al. 2013) and Arizona (Coe et al. 2012)
- Legacy project briefs: Fort Huachuca, AZ and Barry M Goldwater Range, AZ

## Usage Notes

- Users should familiarize themselves with the provided documentation before proceeding with the scoring process.
- Climate projections and species data are required inputs.
- Consider uncertainty values when evaluating vulnerability scores.
